# Learning-Platform-AWT-Project-
Our project is a "learning platform" with two sides: the admin and the user. The admin side adds categories and includes who can access which courses after the admin gives permission. It also has quiz, assignment, and note functionality. The user has access to the available courses and can select, pay for, and gain access to them.
